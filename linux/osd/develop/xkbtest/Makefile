# Makefile

# The compiler to be used
CC = gcc

# Arguments passed to the compiler: -g causes the compiler to insert
# debugging info into the executable and -Wall turns on all warnings
CFLAGS = -g -O2

# The dynamic libraries that the executable needs to be linked to
LDFLAGS = -lxkbfile

# The Dependency Rules
# They take the form
# target : dependency1 dependency2...
#        Command(s) to generate target from dependencies

# Dummy target that is processed by default. It specifies al list of
# other targets that are processed if make is invoked with no arguments
# However if you invoke make as "make output-data", it will only try to 
# generate the file output-data and its dependencies, not plot.png 
all : xkbtest

xkbtest : xkbtest.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) xkbtest.c -o xkbtest

# The clean target is used to remove all machine generated files 
# and start over from a clean slate. This will prove extremely
# useful. It is an example of a dummy target, as there will never be a
# file named clean. Thus "make clean" will always cause the following
# command to be executed.

clean :
	rm -f xkbtest
