General information

Additional Mac OS X keyboard layout file used with a German
keyboard.

The Keyboard Layout follows basically the "Neo Layout" (Version 1.1),
a proposal for an ergonomic optimized German Standard Keyboard from
Hanno Behrens in 2004 (see http://www.neo-layout.org).

The keyboard layout file is approved under the SIL Freeware License
and the keyboard layout itself is approved under the GNU general
Public License.


Installation

Unpack the archive file and copy the .keylayout and .icns file
into the folder .../Library/Keyboard Layouts. Create this folder
if it does not exist already.

After a log out and log in back again, the keyboard layout can
activate in "System Preferences" and "International", "Input Menu".

If "Show input menu in menu bar" is active, you can switch between
the active keyboard layouts in the menu bar.


Background

The keyboard layout can used additional to a standard keyboard
layout, in general all German characters are available too.

The keyboard layout is most similar to the implementation of the
"Neo Layout" (Version 1.1) by Hanno Behrens for Windows and Linux
respectively the X Window System.

The keyboard layout does not fit to the implementation of the Neo
keyboard layout for Mac OS X from 2005.
